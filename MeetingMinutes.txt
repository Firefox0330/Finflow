Meet on 16 sept
1) Detection of the 3 target ions (Ammonium, Nitrate, Nitrite) in the liquid analyte samples through Titration constituted the agenda.

2) A thorough literature review on methods of detection was proposed & recommended.

3) The Titration can be done using 2 pathways: (A) Volumetric / Colorimetric (detecting colour change on reaction/precipitation) (B) Conductometric (Change in Conductivity of solution)

4) A previous attempt at designing an Optoelectronic Devices (Colorimetric titrations through electronics) for the Ammonium Ion was found:

5) A paper discussing Conductometric Titration for Chloride ions was found:

6) The field of microfluidics came up briefly. The lack of accuracy in previous Finflow realizations was also mentioned.

7) An interesting paper which discussed an app for Titrations for colour-blind students was found : https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jchemed.7b00027#

Meet on 19.10.22

1) The Sulphate ion was concluded as the most toxic ion
2) The dependence of LC50 toxicity on combined effect of pH & [SULPHATE] was discussed
3) The variance of toxicity with different species of fish was discussed
4) A Onedrive folder was created for organizing resources & resource handles
